## Mob two: Mob two / Mob beers : 12th July

## Mob two: 12th September 2023

    - Not as much git fun! Progress!
    - Investigated interesting Typescript concepts
    - 7 mins still appears well
    - Mob is still working well.
    - Love Gather!! But lack of GoKart riding. Must do more!
    - Real Beer vs. Virtual racing. Time tbc.

    What was bad?
    - Git fun...(but less)
    - Good spot, prettier alingment between machines/devs.
    - Some syntactic sugar in the tutorial? Some concepts need further investigation which can slow down the mob.
    
    What could be improved?
    - Complete Code Kata in order to improve our understanding of Typescript due to lack thereof in the tutorial.
    - Conways Game of Life Code Kata in Typescript!
    - Start game dev jam ideas.
